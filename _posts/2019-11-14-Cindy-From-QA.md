## **Cindy From QA**

_*[As always, all names have been changed to protect the identities of the individuals]_

I met _Cindy*_ at a monthly company event. She was a fresh graduate, working as the lone Software Tester amongst a group of Software Engineers. From the get-go of our conversation, it was obvious that she was bright. It was also obvious that she didn’t enjoy the people she worked with, as she made it a point to not mingle with any of the Engineers on her team. 

We ignored that fact for a bit, engaging in small talk. All the while, a feeling-out process was occurring—the kind of vibe that continually makes you ask, “Can I let down my professional aura and just be casually honest? Or would that totally bite me in the ass?”

“So,” she paused and smiled, “is your team growing?” This is my favorite approach to corporate honesty. You make a probing joke, but the content is serious. At that point, either you’ll get an acknowledged light-hearted answer or a dead-panned deflect. Either way, you’ll know whether the other party is willing to engage in a more personal conversation.

I looked at Cindy’s Software Engineering teammates who were across the room. “Is working with them that bad?”

The Software Engineers were obnoxious. The Software Engineers were lazy. The Software Engineers were always arguing (but could somehow magically unite on the consensus that their code was bug-free), and Cindy from QA was wrong.

It could’ve been the case that Cindy was just crying wolf, but I had once refactored some of her team’s spaghetti code-base and realized that she likely wasn’t venting for nothing.
“Make plans to leave,” I said, “You don’t have to take their shit. Talk to your manager and ask for an internal transfer.”

“My manager’s on their side too. They work fast, and it makes him look good.” Cindy and I had been having increasingly honest conversations with every monthly company event. “The thing that bothers me most is that even people from outside our team think I’m incompetent now, just because of how the engineers treat me.”
At that moment, the thought flashed across my mind to say something like, “But what’s most important is that you know your self-worth is more than that.” But I thought… nah. I can’t say that. It was an honest conversation now, so we might as well stay honest.

“If everyone starts to think that you’re incompetent… with enough time, it won’t ever matter how good you really are.”

She shot me a look with raised eyebrows. “Is that supposed to cheer me up?”

As human beings, we are social creatures. We tend to believe the things we see; and doubt the things we hear. The exception to this is when we hear a story from someone that we trust. In that case, we tend to believe the stories we hear from third parties, almost as if we saw them ourselves.

If you’ve been alive for any amount of time, this isn’t groundbreaking news; it’s the human foundation for social trust and distrust. We don’t have time to personally vet everything and everyone, so our feelings and opinions of others sometimes just default to this primitive system. 

And this primitive system did not give justice to Cindy’s situation. At the end of the day, Cindy’s manager garnered trust across the organization because of his team’s well-known work-rate. And if he was trustworthy, then if the trustworthy manager vouched for the Software Engineers on his team—by extension the Software Engineers should always be trustworthiness. And if these diligent, fast-working, trustworthy Engineers felt that Cindy was incompetent, who was to say that the perception wasn’t reality? 
Cindy’s situation only got worse every time I met her at an event. Then after a few more, she disappeared—never to be seen again. I’m not sure if she was fired, or just got sick of dealing with everything. The team she was on eventually did have some of their shipped code cause an outage in production though, and that triggered an audit that got their entire team dissolved.
